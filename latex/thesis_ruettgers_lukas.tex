\documentclass{mitthesis} %,fontset=libertine, fontset=newtx-sans-text, fontset=heros-stix2, fontset=stix2
% Use option two-sided for two-sided printing. \documentclass[two-sided]{mitthesis}
%
% option [twoside]		gives facing-page behavior for printing; omitting twoside will eliminate even-numbered blank pages.
% option [lineno]	 	provides line numbers, as for editing
% option [mydesign] 	loads packages for color, title and list formats, margins, or captions: edit mydesign.tex to change defaults.
% option [fontset] is a keyvalue which can be:
%					 	pdftex or unicode engines:  defaultfonts, libertine, lucida
%					 	pdftex only: 				fira-newtxsf, newtx, newtx-sans-text
%						unicode engines (luatex):	heros-stix2, stix2, termes, termes-stix2
%					 	if no key value is given, fonts default to CMR (pdftex) or LMR (unicode), i.e., "the LaTeX font".
%					 	You can edit the fontset files or you can write your own, myfonts.tex, and do [fontset=myfonts].
%						If you are using multiple languages, load the babel package in your fontset file, before the fonts.


%%%%%%%%%  Graphics path (to figure files)  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Can set graphicspath to point to specific directories containing figures (the current directory is searched automatically)
%% For instance, to search a subdirectory of the current directory called "figures" and a parallel directory called "art", set:

% \graphicspath{ {figures/} {../art/} }% For details see: https://latexref.xyz/dev/latex2e.html#g_t_005cgraphicspath


%%%%%%%%%  Representative set-up for biblatex  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\addbibresource{bib/mainref.bib}

%% to avoid split urls and stretched white space, you can set the bibliography ragged-right:
%\appto{\bibsetup}{\raggedright}

% biblatex is very powerful, and you can customize most aspects the reference list and citations to suit your needs.
% documentation is here: https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex

%%% You can use this to rename the bibliography section

%%% Can adjust space between bibliography items (change 4pt to something else; don't drop last two lengths, they are stretchable "glue")
%\setlength\bibsep{4pt plus 1pt minus 1pt}

%%%%%%%%%%  Option for "double spacing" %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Back in the typewriter era, double spaced lines were convenient for editing with a pencil. 
%% In typography, the separation between lines is called "leading", and it is usually set in 
%% proportion to the font size (i.e., when the font is loaded).  If you really feel the need 
%% to change the line separation, the most attractive results will be obtained by changing the
%% leading in proportion to the the current font size, rather than just doubling the space.

%% The setspace package provides a tool for changing line separation. Use these two commands here:
%
% \usepackage{setspace}%  documentation at https://ctan.org/pkg/setspace
% \setstretch{1.1}% you can choose some other value for the stretch of space between lines
%
%% Use one or more of the these commands AFTER the frontmatter
%
% \onehalfspacing
% \doublespacing
% \singlespacing  % will turn these effects off (you can use these anywhere in the document)

%% The best result may be to stay with leading selected by the typographer who set up the font.


%%%%%%%%%%%  Metadata  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Most of the document metadata is created automatically. 
% The following items should be adjusted to match your work. <================= !!!!!!!!!!

\hypersetup{%
	pdfsubject={Kolmogorov complexity and how it illuminates our limitations to let machines learn simple functions},
	
	pdfkeywords={RWTH, THU, Machine Learning, Theory, Deep Learning, Generalization, single source, out of distribution, Ruettgers, Rüttgers, Lukas, bachelor, thesis, Kolmogorov, complexity, compression, learnability, illuminates, limitations, simple, functions, simplicity, machine, learn, non-recursive, recursion, inexpressivity, express, structure},

	% Includes the name[s] of the author[s] 
	% (If you have used \DocumentMetadata, at line 15, you can just put "\CopyrightAuthor," for the names.)
%
	pdfurl={https://github.com/lukas-ruettgers/bachelor-thesis/blob/main/latex/thesis\_ruettgers\_lukas.pdf},
	% If you have a url for the thesis, put it here. Otherwise delete this.
	% (MIT Libraries will put your thesis in DSPACE with a persistent url after you submit it.)
%	
	pdfcontactemail={lukas.ruettgers1@rwth-aachen.de},
	% You can put a [permanent] email address into the metadata, if you like.
	% Otherwise delete this.

%%%%%%%  Solutions for overflowing titlepage  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% If your title page is overflowing (from too many names, degrees, etc.):
%
% (a) you can reduce the 12pt and 18pt skips between various blocks to 6pt with this command:
%
% \Tighten
%
% (b)  you can scale down the Signature block at the bottom with this command:
%
% \SignatureBlockSize{\small}  %or this one \SignatureBlockSize{\footnotesize}
%
% (c) you can put the acceptor name and title onto two lines, rather than three like this:
%
% \Acceptor{Tertius Castor}{Professor and Graduate Officer, Department of Research}{}
% \Acceptor{Quarta Castor}{Professor and Graduate Officer, Department of Mechanical Engineering}{}
%
% (d) you can change the font size of the the author name[s] with
%
%	\AuthorNameSize{\normalsize}
%
% (e) and you can omit any previous degrees from the title page, instead mentioning them in the Biosketch

% Also, if you prefer to keep the text toward the top of the page with most white space at the bottom, you
% can you this command to squash all of the vertical glue (stretchy space) with this command:
%
% \Squash 
%
% This command is useful when the text has not already reach the bottom of the page, since the glue gets squashed automatically
% when the page is too full.
