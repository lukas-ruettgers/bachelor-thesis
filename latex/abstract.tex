%TODO: Write Abstract
Out-of-distribution generalization requires agents to induce from their experience to unseen environments. While recursion is a powerful tool for compressing algorithmic behaviour, the hardness of learning recursive descriptions has impeded its integration into modern machine learning pipelines.

This work puts forward a new complexity measure for algorithmic descriptions that captures the informational "simplicity" of a program and is based on Kolmogorov complexity.
Intuitively, this measure characterizes the complexity of boolean functions by the minimum functional information required to ensure that the simplest algorithm that is consistent with the given information indeed computes the desired function.

With this measure at hand, it emphasizes the efficacy of learning recursive algorithmic descriptions for reasonable behaviour outside of the training distribution, and showcases drawbacks in existing frequently adopted models and optimization objectives in capturing elementary recursive patterns.
